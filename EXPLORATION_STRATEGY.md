## Core Strategy

### 1. First Exploration: Entropy-Optimal Pattern
```
Path: "001122334455..."
```
- Tests all 6 doors for return pairs
- Each return pair reveals ~4.6 bits of structural information
- Identifies self-loops and bidirectional connections

### 2. Adaptive Subsequent Explorations
- **Targeted Testing**: Focus on unmapped doors
- **Path Generation**: Smart routing to reach unmapped areas
- **Bidirectional Inference**: If A:x→B and B:y→A, infer A:x↔B:y

### 3. Key Innovations

#### Return Pair Detection
When pattern "XY" returns to starting state (labels [a,b,a]), we know:
- Room a, door X connects to room b
- Room b, door Y connects back to room a

#### State-Based Tracking
- Track all visited states as paths from start
- Group states by room labels
- Build connection graph incrementally

#### Bidirectional Connection Inference
After exploring, analyze the connection graph:
- If room A door X goes to room B
- And room B has a door going back to room A
- Infer the complete bidirectional mapping

## Implementation Components

1. **AdaptiveExplorer**: Generates optimal exploration paths based on current knowledge
2. **StateTransitionAnalyzer**: Processes exploration results and builds room graph
3. **MockExplorationClient**: Simulates exploration with proper bidirectional connections

## Information Theory Analysis

Each exploration provides:
- **Return pairs**: ~4.6 bits per pair (which rooms connect + door numbers)
- **Self-loops**: ~2.58 bits per discovery
- **New room discovery**: ~1.58 bits (for 3-room configs)

The "001122334455" pattern maximizes early information gain by testing all possible return configurations.

## Future Improvements

1. **Multi-step BFS**: Implement full breadth-first search for reaching distant unmapped doors
2. **Constraint Propagation**: Use logical constraints to deduce connections without exploration
3. **Pattern Library**: Pre-compute optimal patterns for common graph structures
4. **Parallel Hypothesis Testing**: Generate multiple hypotheses and test discriminating paths

## Conclusion

The adaptive multi-exploration approach successfully balances:
- Information gain per exploration
- Computational efficiency
- Robustness to various graph topologies

This strategy should scale well to larger graphs (30+ rooms) by maintaining the same principles of entropy-optimal exploration and adaptive path generation.
