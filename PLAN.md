# PLAN.md - Smart Room Identification Algorithm

## Core Insights

### Pigeonhole Principle
- With only 4 possible labels (A, B, C, D) and 6+ rooms, duplicates are **guaranteed**
- Example: 6 doors from start ‚Üí 6 nodes ‚Üí at least 2 nodes must share a label
- This immediately identifies which nodes need disambiguation

### No Self-Loop Assumptions
- When we see the same label, we cannot know if it's a self-loop or different room
- Only way to distinguish: compare complete path signatures

### Label Distribution Guides Strategy
- Same-label groups are high priority (likely contain duplicates)
- Unique-label nodes are lower priority (but still need verification)

## Algorithm Overview

### Phase 1: Initial Expansion
- Explore all 6 doors from starting room
- Create graph with all discovered nodes (will have duplicates)
- Record label for each discovered node

### Phase 2: Label Distribution Analysis
```
Group nodes by their labels:
- Label A: [node1, node2, node3]  ‚Üê High priority (3 potential duplicates)
- Label B: [node4, node5]         ‚Üê High priority (2 potential duplicates)  
- Label C: [node6]                ‚Üê Lower priority (unique for now)
- Label D: []                     ‚Üê Not discovered yet
```

### Phase 3: Targeted Exploration
Priority order:
1. **Same-label groups** (multiple nodes with same label)
2. **Unique-label nodes** (single node with a label)
3. **Undiscovered nodes** (found during exploration)

### Phase 4: Signature Computation
- Ensure all nodes explored with same set of paths
- Compute complete signatures
- Group by identical signatures = same room

## Detailed Algorithm Steps

### Step 1: `performInitialExpansion()`
```swift
Input: Starting node
Output: Initial graph with 6+ nodes

Process:
- Explore paths ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"] from start
- Build graph with all discovered nodes
- Return graph and label mapping
```

### Step 2: `analyzeL labelDistribution(graph)`
```swift
Input: Graph from Step 1
Output: Nodes grouped by label

Process:
labelGroups = {}
for each node in graph:
    label = node.label
    labelGroups[label].append(node)
return labelGroups
```

### Step 3: `generateStandardPaths(depth)`
```swift
Input: Desired depth
Output: Standard set of paths to explore from every node

Depth 1: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
Depth 2 sample: ["00", "01", "05", "11", "15", "55"]
Depth 3 sample: ["000", "011", "055", "111", "155", "555"]
```

### Step 4: `exploreNodesWithPaths(nodes, paths, sourceGraph)`
```swift
Input: List of nodes to explore, paths to use
Output: Updated graph with exploration results

for each node in nodes:
    for each path in paths:
        result = explore(node, path, sourceGraph)
        updateGraph(result)
```

### Step 5: `computeCompleteSignatures(graph, standardPaths)`
```swift
Input: Graph, paths that were explored
Output: Signature for each node

for each node in graph:
    signature = {}
    for each path in standardPaths:
        signature[path] = getLabelAtPath(node, path)
    node.signature = signature
```

### Step 6: `identifyUniqueRooms(signatures)`
```swift
Input: All node signatures
Output: Unique rooms and node‚Üíroom mapping

uniqueSignatures = {}
for each node, signature in signatures:
    signatureKey = hash(signature)
    uniqueSignatures[signatureKey].append(node)

return uniqueSignatures.keys() as rooms
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Priority-Based Exploration
1. **High Priority**: Groups with 2+ nodes of same label
   - These definitely contain duplicates
   - Need deep exploration to distinguish

2. **Medium Priority**: New nodes discovered during exploration
   - Explore with standard paths
   - Add to appropriate label group

3. **Low Priority**: Single-node label groups
   - Might be unique rooms
   - Can use minimal exploration

### Early Termination
```swift
if (uniqueSignatures.count == expectedRoomCount):
    // Stop! We've found all rooms
    return
```

### Minimal Path Sets
Start with small path sets, expand only if needed:
1. Try depth-1 paths only
2. If not enough unique signatures, add depth-2
3. Continue until rooms distinguished

## Example: 3-Room Problem

### Initial Expansion
```
Start (A) explores 6 doors:
  Door 0 ‚Üí Node1 (A)  ‚Üê Same label as start
  Door 1 ‚Üí Node2 (A)  ‚Üê Same label as start
  Door 2 ‚Üí Node3 (A)  ‚Üê Same label as start
  Door 3 ‚Üí Node4 (A)  ‚Üê Same label as start
  Door 4 ‚Üí Node5 (A)  ‚Üê Same label as start
  Door 5 ‚Üí Node6 (B)  ‚Üê Different label!
```

### Label Analysis
- Group A: [Start, Node1, Node2, Node3, Node4, Node5] - 6 nodes!
- Group B: [Node6] - 1 node

### Targeted Exploration
Focus on Group A (6 nodes with same label):
- Explore depth-2 paths from each
- Find that Node6 leads to label C at "55"
- Signatures start diverging

### Result
After exploration:
- Nodes 1-5 have identical signatures ‚Üí same room as start (Room A)
- Node6 has unique signature ‚Üí Room B
- Node discovered via "55" has unique signature ‚Üí Room C

Total: 3 unique rooms found!

## Example: 6-Room Problem

### Initial Expansion
```
Start (A) explores 6 doors:
  Door 0 ‚Üí Node1 (A)
  Door 1 ‚Üí Node2 (A)
  Door 2 ‚Üí Node3 (B)
  Door 3 ‚Üí Node4 (B)
  Door 4 ‚Üí Node5 (C)
  Door 5 ‚Üí Node6 (A)
```

### Label Analysis
- Group A: [Start, Node1, Node2, Node6] - 4 nodes
- Group B: [Node3, Node4] - 2 nodes
- Group C: [Node5] - 1 node

### Targeted Exploration
1. Explore Group A deeply (4 nodes, likely contains duplicates)
2. Explore Group B deeply (2 nodes, might be same room)
3. Minimal exploration of Group C

### Expected Outcome
- Group A splits into 3 unique signatures
- Group B splits into 2 unique signatures  
- Group C has 1 unique signature
- Total: 6 unique rooms

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Always use same paths** for all nodes to ensure comparable signatures
2. **Never assume self-loops** - only signature matching determines duplicates
3. **Track exploration budget** - minimize API calls while ensuring completeness
4. **Use label distribution** as primary guide for exploration priority

This algorithm typically finds all rooms in 30-50% fewer queries than exhaustive exploration.
