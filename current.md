# ICFP 2025 Contest - Current State & Progress

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a Swift-based solution for the ICFP Programming Contest 2025 "Ædificium Task" - mapping hexagonal library rooms through intelligent exploration algorithms.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **VibeWorker Implementation** ✅
Successfully created an advanced Worker that integrates the sophisticated VibeCoded exploration system with the existing Worker architecture.

#### **Refactored ExplorationOrchestrator**
- **Added Worker-compatible methods**: `generatePlans()`, `processExplored()`, `shouldContinue()`, `generateGuess()`
- **Implemented phase management**: `initialExploration` → `iterativeRefinement` → `finalMapping`
- **Added state tracking**: iteration counting, plan tracking, confidence monitoring
- **Maintained VibeCoded sophistication**: All advanced algorithms preserved

#### **Created VibeWorker Class**
- **Full Worker integration**: Properly delegates to ExplorationOrchestrator
- **Configuration system**: `VibeConfig` with customizable parameters
- **Factory methods**: `forTesting()`, `forContest()` for different scenarios
- **Comprehensive logging**: Real-time phase tracking and confidence monitoring
- **Multiple variants**: Support for different problem types and layouts

#### **Enhanced CLI Support**
- **VibeWorker**: Basic three-room testing with MockExplorationClient
- **VibeWorkerHex**: Hexagon layout testing for more complex scenarios  
- **VibeWorkerContest**: Real contest mode with HTTPExplorationClient
- **Help system**: Shows available worker options when unknown worker specified

#### **Fixed MockExplorationClient**
- **Resolved threeRooms issue**: Added proper `roomConnections` and `roomLabels` setup
- **Working simulation**: Now correctly simulates the 3-room layout for testing
- **Proper exploration**: `explorePath()` method now works correctly with all layouts

## 🧪 Test Status
- **All 41 tests passing** ✅
- **Comprehensive coverage**: GraphBuilder, PathGenerator, GraphEvaluator, NextStepPredictor, ExplorationOrchestrator
- **Mock testing**: MockExplorationClient working correctly for both hexagon and threeRooms layouts

## 🚀 Current Working Features

### **Advanced Exploration Algorithms**
1. **PathGenerator**: Multiple strategies (basic, systematic, targeted BFS/DFS)
2. **GraphBuilder**: Intelligent room mapping with connection inference
3. **GraphEvaluator**: Confidence scoring and completeness detection
4. **NextStepPredictor**: AI-driven path prediction using information gain scoring
5. **ExplorationOrchestrator**: Complete pipeline coordination with phase management

### **Working CLI Commands**
```bash
swift run icfpworker "VibeWorker"        # 3-room test layout
swift run icfpworker "VibeWorkerHex"     # Hexagon test layout  
swift run icfpworker "VibeWorkerContest" # Real contest mode
swift run icfpworker "BasicWorker"       # Simple test worker
```

### **Successful Test Results**
The VibeWorker successfully demonstrates:
- **Room discovery**: Correctly maps 3-room structure (Room 0→1→2)
- **Connection mapping**: Proper door connections and self-loops
- **Label identification**: Accurate 2-bit room labels (0, 1, 2)
- **Phase transitions**: Smart progression through exploration phases
- **Confidence building**: Progressive confidence scoring (54-55% typical)

## 🧠 Graph Theory Analysis & Algorithmic Approach

### Problem Formulation
This is a **labeled directed multigraph reconstruction problem**:
- **Vertices**: Up to 30 rooms with 2-bit labels (only 4 possible values)
- **Edges**: Directed connections through 6 doors per room
- **Challenge**: Multiple rooms share same labels (avg 7-8 rooms per label)
- **Constraint**: Only observe label sequences from paths starting at fixed vertex

### Applicable Graph Theory Algorithms

1. **Graph Isomorphism & Canonical Labeling**
   - Detect when different paths lead to same room
   - Reduce phantom room creation

2. **Chinese Postman Problem Variants**
   - Find optimal paths covering all edges
   - Adapt for partial observability

3. **Distinguishing Sequences (Automata Theory)**
   - Generate minimal paths to differentiate rooms with same label
   - Critical for 30-room scale with only 4 labels

4. **Belief Propagation & Constraint Satisfaction**
   - Propagate connection constraints through graph
   - Infer missing connections from known ones

### Phase 1 Implementation (NEW) - Scalable to 30 Rooms

#### Room Signature Approach
Instead of relying on labels alone, we now use composite signatures:
```
RoomSignature = (label, self-loop doors, transition doors, neighbor label distribution)
```

#### Phase 1 Strategy
1. **Complete single-door exploration** (6 paths)
2. **Two-door return paths** for bidirectional discovery (36 paths)
3. **BFS to depth 2-3** for systematic discovery
4. **Distinguishing sequences** for ambiguous rooms

#### Key Components Added
- **Phase1Analyzer.swift**: Handles room signatures and clustering
- **GraphHypothesis**: Maintains probabilistic graph model
- **Entropy-based path selection**: Coming next

### Expected Performance
- **Small graphs (2-3 rooms)**: ~10-20 explorations
- **Medium graphs (10 rooms)**: ~50-100 explorations
- **Large graphs (30 rooms)**: ~150-200 explorations

The VibeWorker is now ready for contest deployment and provides a sophisticated, tested solution for the ICFP 2025 Ædificium mapping challenge.
